# authbox

A lightweight, modular, async-first authentication framework for Rust.

`authbox` provides a flexible authentication system built around traits, pluggable components, and Tokio-ready async APIs.

It is designed for applications that need customizable authentication logic without being locked into a specific database, framework, or storage backend.
